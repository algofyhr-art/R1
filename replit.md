# Overview

ParcelFlow is a modern parcel processing and routing system designed for distribution centers. The application processes XML parcel data, automatically routes packages to appropriate departments based on configurable business rules, and provides real-time dashboard monitoring. Built with a React frontend and Express backend, it offers comprehensive parcel management with department categorization, insurance handling, and status tracking.

- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, caching, and synchronization
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript running on Node.js
- **API Design**: RESTful API architecture with structured endpoints for parcels, business rules, and dashboard metrics
- **Middleware**: Custom logging middleware for API request tracking and error handling
